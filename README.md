Power ups:
Power ups are special items that give players temporary advantages or abilities in the game. Here are some examples of power ups that could be included in the farming game:
1. FF. FF is a variable as in fast forward. This power up allows players to speed up time on their farm, making crops grow faster and animals produce more quickly.
2. Double Harvest. This power up doubles the yield from crops and animals for a limited time, allowing players to gather more resources quickly.
3. Killer Weed Killer. This power up instantly removes all weeds from the farm, making it easier for players to tend to their crops.
4. Pest Control. This power up eliminates pests that may be damaging crops, ensuring a healthy harvest.
5. VIP Access. This power up grants players access to exclusive areas of the farm or special items that are not available to regular players.
6. Auto Harvester. This power up allows players to automatically harvest crops without having to manually do so, saving time and effort.
7. Auto Harvester Plus. An upgraded version of the Auto Harvester that not only harvests crops automatically but also tends to them, such as watering and fertilizing.
8. Auto Harvester Pro. The ultimate version of the Auto Harvester that includes all the features of the previous versions, plus additional benefits such as increased speed and efficiency.
9. ANC active noise cancelling. This power up reduces background noise in the game, allowing players to focus on their farming tasks without distractions.
10. Super Speed. This power up increases the player's movement speed, allowing them to navigate the farm more quickly.

Power ups can only be used when you are a human. You can only unlock the power ups when you reach level 15. Power ups can be purchased using in-game currency or real money through various payment methods. Some power ups may also be earned as rewards for completing certain tasks or achievements in the game.

We will use a github repository to manage the code for this game. The repository will include all the necessary files, documentation, and version control to ensure smooth development and collaboration among team members.
Here is a link to the github repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Chenboda01/SHEEP_HOME)

After level 123, we will add multiplayer mode so you can play with your friends. You can visit each other's farms, trade items, and complete cooperative farming tasks together. This feature will enhance the social aspect of the game and provide a more engaging experience for players.

After level 321, we will add multiplayer pro mode so you can play with your friends. You can work together to build and manage a large farm, compete in farming competitions, and participate in special events. This mode will offer advanced features and challenges for experienced players looking for a more immersive multiplayer experience.

We are committed to providing regular updates and new content for the game to keep players engaged and entertained. Future updates may include new farming tasks, additional power ups, seasonal events, and more.

This game is developed using Unity, a popular game development engine that allows for high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay. The game is available on multiple platforms, including PC, Mac, and mobile devices.

The game website will be @ Chenboda01.github.io/SHEEP_HOME/. We can use most of the content from the github repository to create the website. The website will provide information about the game, updates, and links to download or purchase the game. 

We don't really have to worry about copyright issues as this game is an original creation and does not use any copyrighted material without permission. However, we will ensure that any third-party assets or resources used in the game are properly licensed and credited.

We don't really need people to purchase this game but they could still download it for free from the github repository or the game website. However, we may offer optional in-game purchases for power ups and special items to support the development and maintenance of the game.

This game is a add-free game so you don't have distracting ads while playing. We believe that ads can detract from the immersive experience of the game, so we have chosen to keep the game ad-free.

All in all, we are excited to bring this farming game to life and provide players with a fun and engaging experience.

Today is the last day of version 2.0 development. Tommorrow we will start working on version 3.0.

Stay tuned for more updates and features in the coming months!

As we continue to develop and improve the game, we welcome feedback and suggestions from players. Your input will help us create a more enjoyable and engaging farming experience for everyone. Thank you for playing!
