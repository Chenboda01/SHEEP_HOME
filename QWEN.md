## Technical Context
Based on the information available, this appears to be a game development project that will use GitHub for version control and collaboration. The current repository contains planning documentation and feature specifications, but the actual implementation details are not yet available in the repository.

## Development Approach
The project follows a level-based progression system where players unlock new features as they advance through levels by completing farming tasks. The game emphasizes realism with its transformation mechanic at level 10, where players can become human characters with enhanced capabilities.

## Current Status
The project is in the planning and early development phase, with detailed specifications for versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 documented. The game will include both single-player progression and future multiplayer capabilities.
